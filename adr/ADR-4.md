## Context

This document describes NATS Headers from the perspective of clients. NATS
headers allow clients to specify additional meta-data in the form of headers.
NATS headers are similar to 
[HTTP Headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2) with some important differences.

As with HTTP headers:

- Each header field consists of a field name followed by a
  colon (`:`), optional leading whitespace, the field value, and optional
  trailing whitespace.
- No spaces are allowed between the header field name and colon.
- Field value may be preceded or followed by optional whitespace.
- The specification may allow any number of strange things like comments/tokens
  etc.
- The keys can repeat.

More specifically from [rfc822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt) Section
3.1.2:

> Once a field has been unfolded, it may be viewed as being composed of a
> field-name followed by a colon (":"), followed by a field-body, and terminated
> by a carriage-return/line-feed. The field-name must be composed of printable
> ASCII characters (i.e., characters that have values between 33. and 126.,
> decimal, except colon). The field-body may be composed of any ASCII
> characters, except CR or LF. (While CR and/or LF may be present in the actual
> text, they are removed by the action of unfolding the field.)

### Unique to NATS Headers

###### Version header
Instead of an HTTP method followed by a resource, and the HTTP version (`GET / HTTP/1.1`),
NATS provides a string identifying the header version (`NATS/X.x`),
currently 1.0, so it is rendered as `NATS/1.0␍␊`.

###### Case preserving
NATS treats application headers as a part of the message _payload_ and is agnostic to the 
application use-case between publishers and subscribers; therefore, NATS headers are _case preserving_.
The server will not change the case in message conveyance, the publisher's case will be preserved.

Any case sensitivity in header interpretation is the responsibility of the application and client participants.

> Note: This is _different_ from HTTP headers which declare/define that web server and user-agent participants should ignore case.

###### Character Encoding
NATS Clients _may_ offer alternate header key and value encodings that are backward-compatible with ASCII.  NATS Clients _should_ use a default header key and value encoding of either UTF-8 (preferred) or ASCII.

With above caveats, please refer to the
[specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2) for information
on how to encode/decode HTTP headers.

### Enabling Message Headers

The server that is able to send and receive headers will specify so in it's
[`INFO`](https://docs.nats.io/nats-protocol/nats-protocol#info) protocol
message. The `headers` field if present, will have a boolean value. If the
client wishes to send headers, it has to enable it must add a `headers` field
with the `true` value in its
[`CONNECT` message](https://docs.nats.io/nats-protocol/nats-protocol#connect):

```
"lang": "node",
"version": "1.2.3",
"protocol": 1,
"headers": true,
...
```

### Publishing Messages With A Header

Messages that include a header have a `HPUB` protocol:

```
HPUB SUBJECT REPLY 23 30␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header: X␍␊␍␊PAYLOAD␍␊
HPUB SUBJECT REPLY 23 23␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header: X␍␊␍␊␍␊
HPUB SUBJECT REPLY 48 55␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header1: X␍␊Header1: Y␍␊Header2: Z␍␊␍␊PAYLOAD␍␊
HPUB SUBJECT REPLY 48 48␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header1: X␍␊Header1: Y␍␊Header2: Z␍␊␍␊␍␊

HPUB <SUBJ> [REPLY] <HDR_LEN> <TOT_LEN>
<HEADER><PAYLOAD>
```

#### NOTES:

- `HDR_LEN` includes the entire serialized header, from the start of the version
  string (`NATS/1.0`) up to and including the ␍␊ before the payload
- `TOT_LEN` the payload length plus the HDR_LEN

### MSG with Headers

Clients will see `HMSG` protocol lines for `MSG`s that contain headers

```
HMSG SUBJECT 1 REPLY 23 30␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header: X␍␊␍␊PAYLOAD␍␊
HMSG SUBJECT 1 REPLY 23 23␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header: X␍␊␍␊␍␊
HMSG SUBJECT 1 REPLY 48 55␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header1: X␍␊Header1: Y␍␊Header2: Z␍␊␍␊PAYLOAD␍␊
HMSG SUBJECT 1 REPLY 48 48␍␊NATS/1.0␍␊Header1: X␍␊Header1: Y␍␊Header2: Z␍␊␍␊␍␊

HMSG <SUBJECT> <SID> [REPLY] <HDR_LEN> <TOT_LEN>
<PAYLOAD>
```

- `HDR_LEN` includes the entire serialized header, from the start of the version
  string (`NATS/1.0`) up to and including the ␍␊ before the payload
- `TOT_LEN` the payload length plus the HDR_LEN

## Decision

Implemented and merged to master.

## Consequences

Use of headers is possible.

## Compatibility Across NATS Clients

The following is a list of features to insure compatibility across NATS clients
that support headers. Because the feature in Go client and nats-server leverage
the Go implementation as described above, the API used will determine how header
names are serialized.

### Case-sensitive Operations

In order to promote compatibility across clients, this section describes how
clients should behave. All operations are _case-sensitive_.  Application implementations
should provide an option(s) to enable clients to work in a case-insensitive or
format header names canonically.

#### Reading Values

`GET` and `VALUES` are case-sensitive operations.

- `GET` returns a `string` of the first value found matching the specified key
  in a case-sensitive lookup or an empty string.
- `VALUES` returns a list of all values that case-sensitive match the specified
  key or an empty/nil/null list.

#### Setting Values

- `APPEND` is a case-sensitive, and case-preserving operation. The header is set
  exactly as specified by the user.
- `SET` and `DELETE` are case-sensitive:
  - `DELETE` removes headers in case-sensitive operation
  - `SET` can be considered the result of a `DELETE` followed by an `APPEND`.
    This means only exact-match keys are deleted, and the specified value is
    added under the specified key.

#### Case-insensitive Option

The operations `GET`, `VALUES`, `SET`, `DELETE`, `APPEND` in the presence of a
`case-insensitive` match requirement, will operate on equivalent matches.

This functionality is constrained as follows:

- `GET` returns the first matching header value in a case-insensitive match.
- `VALUES` returns the union of all headers that case-insensitive match. If the
  exact key is not found, an empty/nil/null list is returned.
- `DELETE` removes the all headers that case-insensitive match the specified
  key.
- `SET` is the combination of a case-insensitive `DELETE` followed by an
  `APPEND`.
- `APPEND` will use the first matching key found and add values. If no key is
  found, values are added to a key preserving the specified case.

> Note that case-insensitive operations are only suggested, and not required to be
implemented by clients, specially if the implementation allows the user code to
easily iterate over keys and values.

### Multiple Header Values Serialization

When serializing, entries that have more than one value should be serialized one
per line. While the http Header standard, prefers values to be a comma separated
list, this introduces additional parsing requirements and ambiguity from client
code. HTTP itself doesn't implement this requirement on headers such as
`Set-Cookie`. Libraries, such as Go, do not interpret comma-separated values as
lists.
