## Motivation

One of the forms of message delivery in JetStream is a pull based
consumers. In this ADR it is described what is the current state of
implementing consumption of messages for this type of consumers.

## Context

A pull based consumer is a type of consumer that does not have a
`delivery subject`, that is the server _does not know_ where to send
the messages.  Instead, the clients have to request for the messages
to be delivered as needed from the server.  For example, given a stream `bar`
with the consumer with a durable name `dur` (all pull subscribers have to be
durable), a pull request would look like this in terms of the
protocol:

```shell
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.x7tkDPDLCOEknrfB4RH1V7.UBZe2D 0
```

### Request Body

There are 3 possible fields that can be presented in the json body of the request.
If there is no body presented (as in the example above, all defaults are assumed.)

#### batch
The number of messages that the server should send. Default is 1, max is 256.

#### no_wait

A boolean value indicating to make this pull request the no wait type. See below for details. Default is false.

#### expires

The number of nanoseconds, from now that this pull will expire. <= 0 or not supplied means the expiration is not applied.
No wait takes precedence over expires if both are supplied.

### Pull(n) Requests

A request with an empty payload is identical to a pull with batch size of 1 and 
results in the server sending the next (1) available message, for example:

```shell
SUB _INBOX.example 0
+OK
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.example 0
+OK
MSG bar 0 $JS.ACK.bar.dur.1.9808.9808.1626818873482533000.0 4
helo
```

Note that even though the inbox used for the request was
`_INBOX.example`, when the message got delivered the subject was
rewritten into `bar` which is the subject of the message that is
persisted in JetStream.

A pull request for the next message, will linger until there is no
more interest in the subject, a client is disconnected or the batch size is filled.
Each pull request will increase the `num_awaiting` counter for a consumer of
inflight pull requests [2].  At most, a consumer can only have 512
inflight pull requests, though this can be changed when creating the
consumer with the `max_waiting` option [1]:

```shell
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO.bar.dur _INBOX.uMfJLECClHCs0CLfWF7Rsj.ds2ZxC4o 0
MSG _INBOX.uMfJLECClHCs0CLfWF7Rsj.ds2ZxC4o 1 601
{
    "type": "io.nats.jetstream.api.v1.consumer_info_response",
    "stream_name": "bar",
    "name": "dur",
    "created": "2021-07-20T21:35:11.825973Z",
    "config": {
        "durable_name": "dur",
        "deliver_policy": "all",
        "ack_policy": "explicit",
        "ack_wait": 30000000000,
        "max_deliver": -1,
        "filter_subject": "bar",
        "replay_policy": "instant",
        "max_waiting": 512,          <-- Maximum Inflight Pull/Fetch Requests [1]
        "max_ack_pending": 20000
    },
    "delivered": {
        "consumer_seq": 11561,
        "stream_seq": 11560
    },
    "ack_floor": {
        "consumer_seq": 11561,
        "stream_seq": 11560
    },
    "num_ack_pending": 0,
    "num_redelivered": 0,
    "num_waiting": 1,                <-- Inflight Pull/Fetch Requests [2]
    "num_pending": 0,
    "cluster": {
        "leader": "NCUOUH6YICRESE73CKTXESMGA4ZN4KTELXPUIE6JCRTL6IF4UWE3B2Z4"
    }
}
```

When making a pull request it is also possible to request more than one message:

```shell
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.x7tkDPDLCOEknrfB4RH1V7.OgY4M7 32
{"batch":5,"expires":4990000000}
```

Whenever a pull request times out, the count of `num_waiting` will increase for a consumer
but this will eventually reset once it reaches the max waiting inflight that was configured
for the pull consumer.

### No Wait Pull Requests

In order to get a response from the server rigth away, a client can
make a pull request with the `no_wait` option enabled. For example:

```shell
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.x7tkDPDLCOEknrfB4RH1V7.OgY4M7 26
{"batch":1,"no_wait":true}
```

The result of a no wait pull request is a guaranteed instant response
from the server that will be either the next message or an error,
where an error could be a server error such as `503` in case JS
service is not available. Most commonly, the result of a no wait pull
request will be a `404` no messages error:

```shell
HMSG _INBOX.x7tkDPDLCOEknrfB4RH1V7.OgY4M7 2  28 28
NATS/1.0 404 No Messages
```

## Design

The implementation for pull subscribe uses a combination of both no wait and
lingering pull requests described previously.

In the Go client, a simple example of the API looks as follows:

```go
sub, err := js.PullSubscribe("stream-name", "durable")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

for {
	msgs, err := sub.Fetch(1)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Error:", err)
		continue
	}
	for _, msg := range msgs {
		msg.Ack()
	}
}
```

When implementing `PullSubscribe` there are two main cases to
consider: `Pull(n)` and `Pull(1)`.

#### Pull(n)

`Pull(n)` batch requests are implemented somewhat similarly to old style
requests.  When making a pull request, first a no wait request is
done to try to get the messages that may already be available as
needed.  If there are no messages (a 404 status message error by the
JetStream server), then a long pull request is made:

```shell
SUB _INBOX.NQ2uAIXd4GoozKOTfECtIg  1
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.WvaJLnIXcj8Zf5SrxlHMTS 26
{"batch":5,"no_wait":true}

# Result of no wait request if there are no messages
HMSG _INBOX.WvaJLnIXcj8Zf5SrxlHMTS 8  28 28
NATS/1.0 404 No Messages

# Next pull request is a long pull request with client side timeout
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.NQ2uAIXd4GoozKOTfECtIg 32
{"expires":4990000000,"batch":5}
```

As part of the request payload, the `batch` field is set to the number
of expected messages and `expires` is set to cancel the request
`100ms` before the client side timeout.  In the example above, the
timeout is `5s` so in the payload `expires` is the result of `5s -
100ms` represented in nanoseconds.

After making the first request no wait request, it is also recommended
to send an auto unsubscribe protocol discounting the message already
received as a result of the no wait request.  In case the batch
request was for 5 messages, the client would auto unsubscribe after
receiving 6. Since first message was an error the `UNSUB` is (batch+1)
to account for that initial error status message.

```shell
UNSUB 1 6
```

When successful, the result of a batch request will be at least one
message being delivered to the client.  In case not all messages are
delivered and the client times out or goes away during the pull
request, it is recommended to unsubscribe to remove the interest of
the awaited messages from the server, otherwise this risks the server
sending messages to an inbox from a connected client that is no longer
expecting messages.

```shell
SUB _INBOX.WvaJLnIXcj8Zf5SrxlHMTS  1
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.WvaJLnIXcj8Zf5SrxlHMTS 26
{"batch":5,"no_wait":true}
HMSG _INBOX.WvaJLnIXcj8Zf5SrxlHMTS 8  28 28
NATS/1.0 404 No Messages
UNSUB 1 6
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.WvaJLnIXcj8Zf5SrxlHMTS 32
{"expires":4990000000,"batch":5}
MSG hello 1 $JS.ACK.bar.dur.2.29034.29041.1626845015078897000.0 4
helo
# Only 1 out of 5 messages receives, so client goes away and unsubscribes.
UNSUB 1
```

##### Errors and Status messages handling

While receiving messages, at any point the client may instead
receive an error from the server as a status message.

```sh
MSG hello 1 $JS.ACK.bar.dur.2.29034.29041.1626845015078897000.0 5
hello
# (System reached too many inflight pull requests condition)
HMSG _INBOX.WvaJLnIXcj8Zf5SrxlHMRI 1  32 32
NATS/1.0 408 Request Timeout
```

Whenever there is a status message, it is recommended that the error
is not returned to the user as a processable message and instead handle
is as the error condition:

```go
for {
	msgs, err := sub.Fetch(5)
	if err != nil {
		// Any error such as:
		// 
		// - client timeout
		// - request timeout (408)
		// - bad request
		// - no responders
		// - system unavailable (no current JS quorum)
		log.Println("Error:", err)
		continue
	}
	// Msgs here are never status or error messages,
	// in case there is an error the loop just breaks.
	for _, msg := range msgs {
		msg.Ack()
	}
}
```

#### Pull Optimization

For the case of pulling a single message, it is possible to optimize
things by making the first pull request as a no wait request instead
and by preparing a new style like request/response handler using a wildcard
subscription.  This will result in less chatty protocol and also works better with
topologies where JetStream is running as a leafnode on the edge.

```shell
SUB _INBOX.miOJjN58koGhobmCGCWKJz.*  2
PUB $JS.API.CONSUMER.MSG.NEXT.bar.dur _INBOX.miOJjN58koGhobmCGCWKJz.asdf 26
{"batch":1,"no_wait":true}
```

Similar to `Pull(n)`, when the first no wait request fails, 
after the first `Pull(1)` a longer old style request is made with a
unique inbox.

**Note**: Each pull subscriber must have its own pull request/response handler.
The default implementation of new style request cannot be used for this
purpose due to how the subject gets rewritten which would cause responses to be dropped.
